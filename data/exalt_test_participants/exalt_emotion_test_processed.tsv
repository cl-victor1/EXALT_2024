2055	 Come on, these polls, these ratings. they mean nothing, your nonsense, we only estimate the quality of a transfer window at the end of the season. You have to stay logical a little. 
2944	 Some from FI deserve more than others. This individual tries so hard that we understand that even when wrong, bad faith knows no limits, as he wants to believe that everyone is wrong but not him. 
1945	 As long as you pretend by saying a community made up of people from immigration and the former territories of the republic lives on our soil and like the Corsicans and the Bretons want to maintain a tradition, you will be completely missing the point because it is here. 
2877	We could have made a great team and written a beautiful story, it's too sad that you were blinded by your past but that's life.

1903	 I didn't have time üò≠ I hope it was cool! 
1697	 I love the meticulousness of the mechanism that allows us to understand how one becomes the director of a concentration camp, how one puts conscience to sleep to act almost in spite of oneself‚Ä¶ RM has managed to make the downward slope plausible, possible.

2004	 Especially since you have 0 references with Wembanyama, how can you estimate that his absence is an explanation? From the moment those present did not give their all or were not used correctly, there are no external culprits to seek. 
1491	No really? It's not like I'm on the train and you already said it, right? What's the point of this kind of email? (10 minutes after we left, by the way. ) 
2157	 But it's just that I can't accept this assumption. Given the folkloric images, I don't believe it for a second, otherwise I was quite willing. Although your sensitivity to ridicule seems lower, we would always have shared the same dream. 
2636	 That's what it's like to have a clan-based policy. No one to catch the other. Just groupthink. 
1933	 Hello my Francky from Hollywood üòò üòò üòò
2536	 It's not because reality opposes your thinking that it's orchestrated to disparage you. Only some people are more skilled than others. 
3194	Invest instead of being stingy 
1571	 Well, to get ahead in life you need to be a little bit bad. Otherwise, you won't have anything more than the bare minimum (and even that's questionable) in your life, and you won't feel better about yourself. And to change radically past a certain age, the pursuit of revenge can be a good alternative.

1541	 It's stupid that you refused to have a brain injected! 
1840	Beautiful wedding dress but not fitted. Necklace + vest too much. Poor cut, material. Does not match the dress. I would have liked to see it with a white chiffon stole. It would have covered her shoulders but with a lightness in the outfit. #4MariagesPour1LuneDeMiel
2459	May God calm my right-wing impulses when a certain category of dual nationals make certain statements about the situation in Gabon. 
2141	 The abaya is not religious but has been transformed into something religious. So, if one day the cloclo collar is turned into something religious, it will also be banned.

2621	 Do you know the agreements for Monaco to be able to play in L1 and the links between the principality and France? Do you think Juve could also ask to play in L1? Your example is not comparable at all. Get upset but the label is not scandalous at all.

2480	Russia thwarts attacks. Russia claims. Russia declares. I went through the French press and I see that it is recording the words of the kind Russians. Are you preparing public opinion for the abandonment of the wicked Ukrainians? 
2669	 I wonder if the PCF is drifting, but I fear it's more about their unfiltered foundation surfacing ‚òπÔ∏è
2949	You see, about the #abaya story in Anglo-Saxon countries, influential people concerned would have immediately reacted. But sorry, in France we only have hypocrites and scaredy-cats. it's a minority that speaks and yet. Shame on you!

2165	 Obviously, but in Lobry's case it remains a minor detail for me because he is not a problematic player, he has always accepted competition and he will give what he can when called upon. 
2940	 Because Catholics live their faith without hatred for others, otherwise we would have huge, ultra-visible crosses. But it seems to me that it is forbidden to wear a visible cross inside a school out of concern for fairness.

It's complicated to prepare for the philosophy exam without a philosophy teacher. Fortunately, I was able to guide my son and give him the necessary basics. In short, there are still real priorities to address. 
3291	 That being said, we talk and talk, but our high school in Gradignan suited us to a tee. Surrounded by vineyards, with all the farmers from South Gironde who were somewhat discovering civilization. Nah, that high school was grim, full of shitty farmers.

1408	 P Seguin remained a Gaullist. Those who pushed him out of the RPR leadership did not appreciate this: the pro-European centrist Juppe. Together with Chirac, they were determined to remove all the historic Gaullists. The break came in 2007 with the rejection of the referendum, a Sarkozyist betrayal.

6075	It's not the Unified State Exam (EGE) or Basic State Exam (OGE) that are at fault. The fault lies with the teachers. Those who went into education because it was free. Their knowledge from other universities was insufficient. Underqualified individuals became teachers. The teaching profession has been discredited by the teachers themselves, and now they are discrediting the exams. The bribes have ended.
