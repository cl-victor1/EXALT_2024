3319	 In his deadly anguish, all dangers would have seemed preferable to him. How often did he not wish to see some affair befall Madame de Rênal
3237	 Oh, I didn't see that one! I'm finishing The Bear and then I'll check it out 👀
2004	 Especially since you have 0 references with Wembanyama, how can you estimate that his absence is an explanation? From the moment those present did not give their all or were not used correctly, there are no external culprits to seek. 
1491	No really? It's not like I'm on the train and you already said it, right? What's the point of this kind of email? (10 minutes after we left, by the way. ) 
2157	 But it's just that I can't accept this assumption. Given the folkloric images, I don't believe it for a second, otherwise I was quite willing. Although your sensitivity to ridicule seems lower, we would always have shared the same dream. 
2636	 That's what it's like to have a clan-based policy. No one to catch the other. Just groupthink. 
1933	 Hello my Francky from Hollywood 😘 😘 😘

3194	Invest instead of being stingy 
1571	 Well, to get ahead in life you need to be a little bit bad. Otherwise, you won't have anything more than the bare minimum (and even that's questionable) in your life, and you won't feel better about yourself. And to change radically past a certain age, the pursuit of revenge can be a good alternative.

2059	 No one is going to ban planes, boats, trains, cars, bikes, or trams because there are accidents, but he is in the right group of victims and demagogues.

3055	I'm healing my wounds alone, I need a woman, she would have played the nurse. 
1678	 Ferocious is an understatement. Those were also bloody massacres. We are waiting for LFI to eventually take on Islam with the same arrogance. 
3315	 You haven’t even started and you're already freaking out? More power to you 💪🏾
1541	 It's stupid that you refused to have a brain injected! 
1840	Beautiful wedding dress but not fitted. Necklace + vest too much. Poor cut, material. Does not match the dress. I would have liked to see it with a white chiffon stole. It would have covered her shoulders but with a lightness in the outfit. #4MariagesPour1LuneDeMiel
2459	May God calm my right-wing impulses when a certain category of dual nationals make certain statements about the situation in Gabon. 
2141	 The abaya is not religious but has been transformed into something religious. So, if one day the cloclo collar is turned into something religious, it will also be banned. Moreover, talking about Catholics, from whom crosses have been removed since 1905 in this matter, is more than inappropriate. 
2435	 Thank you! In November in La Rochelle, I'll be there ❤️
2966	" ""this ode to our teachers"" but I can't stand it anymore these people are crazy 🤣"

1644	 You guys are such stat nerds, it's crazy to have nothing to chew on like that and cling to Twitter views or impressions. Yes, you have the biggest community in France (with your fair share of idiots, by the way), but what does that change for eSports? 
1344	 or you can shut your mouth instead of absolutely insisting that young teens discover themselves, you dirty obsessed person. 
2663	 The little lab technician who wants to reboot his business with hypochondriacs because he had trouble paying his installments since 2022 I think there will be fewer customers unfortunately Open a garage, you'll get to handle lots of fluids and you'll actually be useful
2621	 Do you know the agreements for Monaco to be able to play in L1 and the links between the principality and France? Do you think Juve could also ask to play in L1? Your example is not comparable at all. Get upset but the label is not scandalous at all. 
2323	In case of defeat? Because there are people who think we can win on Sunday? (I just want to say that it's possible but it would be a huge stroke of luck)  //

2544	 Apparently you act as if you were better 10 years ago and Tshisekedi came and ruined everything. What makes you think you are Congolese? And that those you call your parents there are your real parents? 
2410	I will never tire of the fact that for the SNCF at 60 years old one is no longer an adult 🙄 And these cards are on promo for 24. 50 instead of 49 which is very quickly amortized. 
1726	 In reality, all of this endangers women who are not veiled. The impure ones who can be attacked or even raped because they are there for that, otherwise they would be veiled… Did I get it right? 
2824	 that's so nice 🤍 🤍, I'm sure that one day you will also be happy and that you will find someone with whom you can settle down; at least I hope so for you 🫡
2480	Russia thwarts attacks. Russia claims. Russia declares. I went through the French press and I see that it is recording the words of the kind Russians. Are you preparing public opinion for the abandonment of the wicked Ukrainians? 
2669	 I wonder if the PCF is drifting, but I fear it's more about their unfiltered foundation surfacing ☹️
2949	You see, about the #abaya story in Anglo-Saxon countries, influential people concerned would have immediately reacted. But sorry, in France we only have hypocrites and scaredy-cats. it's a minority that speaks and yet. Shame on you! 
2623	 You are right, but to see arrogance among Blacks proves that we do not hold the monopoly on it. especially among our former internationals.

1374	 same Mr. Michelet, I remember (it was in college) he told us about the Battle of Gravelines in 1588 between the English and the Invincible Armada. He was jumping around, slaying invisible enemies; on our side, we were all captivated. I've kept that lively aspect in being a teacher. 
3289	" So. Shortly after you left, I literally said ""If I lose Keldeo it's over"" Well, I lost it and. "

1951	 You're making a mountain out of a molehill. It's not about bravery, unless you work at Libé there's a good chance you're not alone and there's no need to dampen the mood by being unpleasant, we can handle it normally and without any particular seriousness. 
2907	As if you hadn't, you and all the far-left penguins, fueled the affair on social networks. You are the worst in politics. 
2446	 Let's see if by then I can find a job. But in any case, it will at least be based on my experience 🙂
3229	 The French fascist party was founded by a former member of the communist party. Laval was from the left. There were SS members at the creation of the RN but also resistants, which was the norm in all post-war parties since De Gaulle did not want to conduct a purge. 
3002	 Were you born in a test tube? Did your father try to steal a kiss from your mother? Did she file a complaint against him? If she hadn't agreed, she would have pushed him away and if he had insisted, would have slapped him. This player did nothing like that.

2510	If that other person hadn't been annoying, I would have done it right away, but no, that's why I forgot about it. 
3250	 It gives objective reasons for climate skeptics to say, you see they exaggerate. If you say that French glaciers will have disappeared by 2025, a climate skeptic will latch onto 2025, whereas the disappearance of glaciers, even by the end of the century, is serious. 
2275	Following in the points are the two Saubers of Massa and Fisichella, Klien, Coulthard, and Panis. Only Nick Heidfeld is classified, the 11 other drivers having retired! #F1 #Formula1 #OnThisDay

2165	 Obviously, but in Lobry's case it remains a minor detail for me because he is not a problematic player, he has always accepted competition and he will give what he can when called upon. 
2940	 Because Catholics live their faith without hatred for others, otherwise we would have huge, ultra-visible crosses. But it seems to me that it is forbidden to wear a visible cross inside a school out of concern for fairness.

2208	 I especially hope that my children will have ALL their teachers at the start of the school year (middle school and high school). It's complicated to prepare for the philosophy exam without a philosophy teacher. Fortunately, I was able to guide my son and give him the necessary basics. In short, there are still real priorities to address. 
3291	 That being said, we talk and talk, but our high school in Gradignan suited us to a tee. Surrounded by vineyards, with all the farmers from South Gironde who were somewhat discovering civilization. Nah, that high school was grim, full of shitty farmers.

1906	" ""to face it"": ok, ""different opinions"": false. Facts are increasingly documented, refuting or minimizing climate change for subjective or political reasons is quite dishonest. "
3045	 I hear you well, it's not tolerable, but in this specific case, let's not lie to ourselves, it's just a short-term political calculation to flatter the far right. A doubly disastrous PR strategy with uncertain consequences, especially after the summer riots. 
1402	My fellow compatriots, join us in large numbers to follow live (Facebook) our analysis of the state of fundamental freedoms in our country. It will be conducted in French and Arabic. YDDB.

1626	Where is the advantage code to get the SNCF discount card? I received the email but no code @SNCFConnect
2989	 Seeing is believing, it's incredible. We have become a very strange society, prudish, exhibitionist, porn everywhere, hypocritical. It's as if the compass was completely off course. 
1420	 Content oh that's more like it. It's for me the best James Mangold movie. 
1452	 The proof, I have you on a leash. I lead you on winding paths and like a vulture, you overreact. Promise tomorrow, you'll have your bone that you can share with your buddies. Good night, Rantanplan. 
2312	 Everyone says it's his mother who would like him to go to Madrid, but on Saturday she looked very happy in the stands watching the game played by PSG and seeing her son score. 
3101	 Ah yes! I had forgotten about that. The reason given was saving bricks. The wall being longer, certainly, but in the end, this structure allows for just a single row of bricks and moreover, without buttresses. 
3228	 There are quite a few young people who have arrived, I saw, I don't find it so bad. The big departure for Brest might indeed be boring, but if it goes as well as this start of the season, it will be a great season. 
2233	 Oh my God, just stop with your pathetic excuses. Stop messing things up, make some money, and get out. If you're waiting for welfare to immigrate, we're in trouble. 
2667	I was just 10 years old when I was first exposed to pornographic content. Barely 10 years old. Everyone here will agree that it's WAY too young, even horribly young.

2905	 DEGIRO or Trade Republic 😉 I learned that on Trading 212 you're not 100% owner of your stocks, I don’t like that. 
1408	 P Seguin remained a Gaullist. Those who pushed him out of the RPR leadership did not appreciate this: the pro-European centrist Juppe. Together with Chirac, they were determined to remove all the historic Gaullists. The break came in 2007 with the rejection of the referendum, a Sarkozyist betrayal. 
2085	" ""Footix"" already and moreover you're too stupid, kind of sucker for the old times, you're 20 years old pretending to be the mature dude who knows Maradona and big idiot, stop it a bit 😂 😂 😂"

2334	According to the MP, the United States would be behind the sabotage. 
2512	 you do not have the right to choose outfits for women, that's what I do not accept. If recognized as religious, qamis and abayas must be banned in schools, but you can't force a curvy girl to wear tight clothes, where are we at with this? 
1507	 Alcohol does not increase, it disinhibits, which sometimes gives more ease, but it does not increase strength or the ability to concentrate, and even less so intellectual performance. 
2691	 And the E3C also got canceled! There remains this huge problem of forcibly removing a specialty in the final year! (the reason why we actually just need to throw the whole organization of specializing + common core in the trash)

2343	 In any case, LFI is not a friend of women. #QuatennensResign
2017	Because yes, if he pays, believe me, he wants to sleep with her, otherwise he whines. Guys like that, put them in the trash even if they have money. Money doesn't deserve you being treated that way. 
3184	 Saliba was a loan without an option to buy. If the player explodes, you can’t keep him. Kamara always intended to leave the club for free, the plan had been set for years, so again, you can do nothing. I would have liked to keep both but you don’t have control…

2651	 It has always been like this, except when in a position of political domination. To spread throughout the Roman Empire, Christianity had to deeply Romanize itself, absorbing Roman cultural markers. We talk about pagano-Christianity. It was Paul who started this work.

2398	Lol, I just met my second roommate and he's half naked. 😐 (but you were right  and  he is pretty hot, even I admit it)
2388	" Padre Pio's vision will come true: ""Russia will teach the West a lesson. "" But as no one takes mystics seriously anymore, the surprise will be huge. "

3236	After what concerns the top, it's me who manages, and for a long time I have always been prepared for the top anyway, so sometimes people make fun of me because I'm on earth. 
2834	 you bark but you still want to enjoy French culture. As for what we would have stolen, ask yourself about your degree of evolution if France had not colonized you. Instead of acting like the kings of Sapology, you would be naked eating caterpillars. 
2419	 So she wants to replace black women by taking their fetishist men? What is this mental illness? Why do you insult your beautiful sisters like that? Are they in the gin?

4055	 Hi Tinus, no at the door only for half an hour. People with multiple stickers probably bought tickets online. 
3625	 And all the while UDP must struggle to gain respect during, for example, New Year's Eve. Have a nice New Year's Eve, rude piece of food. 
3785	 What a crazy question. Feyenoord also always rents architects and marketers from the Netherlands' biggest cesspool of corruption. 
3534	 Also agree! NL is definitely a prosperous country! But these racial issues are also a matter of time. it's international and calls for choices, on our collective inner morals. How will we deal with this! Will we join in the SJW debate or make our own moral choices here? 
3461	 Lonneke! Do you think you can just speak for 'the' residents of Vestdijk? Shame you didn't do some research with your fellow residents first. I've also never seen you at an information evening. 
4062	 Madam. Be sensible. Give up your party. D66 can no longer be saved. All drugged beings. Take a look at all the Lady Lullegroen for once.

3402	 Hi, I fear that this train has experienced a significant delay due to a personal accident between Diest and Hasselt. The train should arrive in Hasselt in a few minutes ^ jd
3568	 I agree, Sjoerd. And that's not because we want to pat ourselves on the back. This is just a piece of awareness. Take care of the North Sea that provides our bread. 
3827	Is this begging? I think it's just asking for what you are entitled to. The NPOs are the ones begging. And the mafia in Brussels just appropriates stuff. 'Thierry Baudet begs for subsidy'  via 
3530	 Also from me all the best for 2018! As cliché as it is: good health and lots of love 😊 ❤ and I really mean that too. 😊
3376	 Het Doelum is there for everyone and does not take a political stance. Happy 2018. 
3537	 Isn't that one of the few retro records that still often come on #stubru? 
4044	 Good evening. Some time ago I ordered crockery from you (DINERA - 18-piece). Last week I received an email from you informing me that the order is delayed by 3 weeks. 
3352	 I don't even know you and yet I'm glad you're back in my timeline 🙋
3653	 The masks are coming off. Thanks  for ruining my birthday into 50. The little pension I may have is already nothing and now taxed on the amount I am saving. And my electricity will also increase thanks to you. Robbers of 
4075	 I am very happy about that. People are people. You have kind people and scoundrels, in every nation and every religion. 
3835	 I think the people three streets down could still hear me scream at that goal. 
3699	People who read NRC and think they now know more about crypto than us. You could call them scripted people, who are too uninterested in the world and explore too little to deviate from what is spoon-fed to them. 
4079	 First time I see this. I don't think it happened. 
3617	"clients, the ""humanists"" (the quotation marks are intentional) offered the street and dirt-poor author no financial compensation for writing and publishing the book. They definitely don't want their secrets to be revealed. The book can only be found for free on the internet. "
4072	 We as a profession will not lose that image, unfortunately. Unless there are no incidents for 5 years. Otherwise, there are too many stakeholders to fan the flames of that image with every incident. But keep feeling affected. That speaks well for you. 
3360	 Relatable. I even considered unfollowing all of someone's followers just to avoid it, but there were quite a lot of them. Guess I'll suffer every now and then 😁
3407	 It doesn't really matter to me. But your mechanic sells hardware on Marktplaats. Patrick is selling powerlines from you guys. 
4014	 Camiel is only expressing regret now because it has become such a media circus. 
3714	No, they are crazy. They are not refugees either. Most of them are on their way home again. These are economic migrants, who deliberately choose the countries with the best benefits. Searched on their smartphone. 
3420	 The worst is the night after, when you want to go to sleep at your normal time because you have to get up early the next day, and then you can't. 
4005	 Sharp here and there. But with your assertion that the Minister of the Interior wants to ban social media, you cast suspicion on yourself that in your fight against mainstream media you are just fantasizing. A lie as big as the one you accuse your opponents of. Grotesque. 
3777	 It is a fact that when van Mierlo wanted the referendum, society since 1966 was tipping from right to left. A referendum could opportunistically give a push in a leftist direction. Now we are in the same but opposite situation. 
3855	 Curtains closed, cuddle up, and when you're gone, turn the radio up loud and make sure they can't look outside. 
4053	I can't think of a better Christmas morning than starting it with Last Christmas on  and waiting for the #Top2000 to start! 
3671	Just got home from a cozy evening at Bar Noordeinde in Workum. The guest speaker was Johan Derksen and the organizer was Jan Tiemen Vries. Thanks a lot to both, it was a very fun evening! Wishing everyone a happy new year and see you soon! Warm regards from Stavoren.

3670	 Hi Cees, it's unpleasant that the playback of recordings doesn't always go well. Does the particular recording stop at the same point each time? And do you get a specific (error) message when a recording doesn't start, or what exactly happens then? Does watching live TV go smoothly? 1/3

3832	Beautiful day to do things you really should have done much earlier! 
3509	 This is also why all those PoW alternatives are usually broken; often designed by people who do not understand that the network integrity of Bitcoin is built on being expensive, and they present this alternative as cheaper as a marketing point instead of a weakness in their design. 
3428	 Sad that you want to see someone blocked, what an unpleasant mentality. You should also take a look at the lists of the top 1000 most wanted criminals in the Netherlands, England, etc. And then come back.
