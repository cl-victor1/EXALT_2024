In regard to the emotional words:

- ""supervisar"" (supervise) - This verb could be contributing to the emotion because it might suggest a condescending or overseeing action that is not well-received.
- ""colonos"" (colonists) - This term can be loaded and might be used here to impart a sense of external control or historical subjugation, thus evoking a negative or sour sentiment.

The words indicating surprise and slight frustration are overshadowed by the celebration highlighted by ""gefeliciteerd"" (congratulations) which is a key indicator of a positive emotional expression towards another person, likely a close one given the use of ""schat"" (dear).
