Neutral	Neutral	The tweet appears to be in Russian, which I cannot fully understand. However, based on the limited context and tone, the tweet seems to be describing a neutral or mundane interaction between the author and an elderly woman, likely a friend of their grandmother. The author mentions going for a walk late at night to meet a friend, and the elderly woman inquires about their plans. Without any strong emotional indicators, the tweet is best classified as neutral in emotion. 	The tweet describes a light-hearted and somewhat curious interaction where someone is explaining their plans to an elderly friend's acquaintance who is concerned and inquiring about the details of late evening plans.
